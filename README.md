# 🌞 Decentralized Solar Energy and Rural Livelihoods

### A Case Study of Aveyime, Volta Region, Ghana

This repository contains data, figures, and research outputs from a mixed-methods, participatory study examining the **socio-economic impacts of decentralized solar energy adoption** in **Aveyime**, a rural community in Ghana’s Volta Region.

The project integrates **empirical analysis**, **community-led awareness campaigns**, and **policy-oriented synthesis** to provide a **replicable model** for scaling inclusive solar energy solutions across rural West Africa.

## 🧩 Methodological Approach

* **Mixed methods:** Household surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews
* **Participatory action research**
* **Community Ambassador Model** for awareness and trust-building
* Longitudinal comparison of baseline and follow-up indicators

---

## 🧠 Policy and Practice Relevance

This project demonstrates that **technology alone is insufficient**. Meaningful and sustained impact emerged from combining decentralized solar solutions with **localized awareness, trust-building, and community leadership**.

The findings support:

* Results-based financing for rural solar
* PAYGo and micro-credit schemes
* Gender-responsive energy policies
* Integration of community intermediaries into electrification strategies

---

## 🔁 Replicability

The Aveyime model is designed to be:

* **Scalable** across off-grid and weak-grid communities
* **Adaptable** to different socio-cultural contexts
* **Cost-effective** for NGOs, governments, and donors
